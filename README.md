# MMath Group Project 2020/21

This repository contains the code that forms the backbone of my section of the MMath Group Project I am currently working on as part of my degree.

The project is looking at some of the mathematics involved in solving problems in virology. For me, this has come down to evaluating numerical methods for solving differntial equations.
I am using a case study of the standard model of in-host viral dynamics to explore thse algorithms.
